#Upload Methods:
From linux, navigate to the folder the github is in. (Presuming it's linked to it) Using 'git status' in the terminal will confirm if it's connected.

Using the command "nano FILENAME" will create a file. using a .py extension makes it python. This file can then be edited in the terminal and whatever commands can be written to it.

testing: "python3 FILENAME" will run the file.

UPLOADING:
confirm it needs to be updated with "git status"
Use "git add FILENAME"
then "git commit -m "COMMENT HERE" "
"git push"

Then the file should be commited to github.
