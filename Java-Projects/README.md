# How To Run:

Java can be created in most txts (Notepad++ for instance) and saved as .java, but will be easier to use in environments like eclipse.



To run, run them in eclipse to test or can run them after compiling. 



Might need java installed though, which can be done in several ways (oracle.com for the laziest folks, just pick the OS!)



# Java Projects

Projects primarily coded in the java language. Larger projects made by me.



# Java21Days

One method of learning Java, created in runnable formats. These are available on www.java21days.com too, but are recreated here for easier customization.



# Java Sorts

Created java sorts in main methods. To be done: custom sorts/inputs.



# Custom Exercises

Projects created for the sake of knowledge using limitations and restrictions to increase programming knowledge.

These exercises are generally self-made.
