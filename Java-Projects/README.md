# How To Run:

Java can be created in most txts (Notepad++ for instance) and saved as .java, but will be easier to use in enviroments like eclipse.



To run, run them in eclipse to test or can run them after compiling. Might need java installed though, which can be done in several ways (oracle.com for the laziest folks, just pick the OS!)

Using the command line you can then select the location of it and then "java -jar PROGRAM.jar" should execute it.
