This is a simple test file made using notepad++ only and compiling using the command interface.

HOWTO:

Create the files and end them in the .java extension. Ensure they are in the same folder. For organization purposes, just have one folder using the program.

Open up the command interface and change to the folder file. IE:

cd C:\...rest of file path.

THEN RUN:
javac NamesofEACHFile.java

Then run the main one
java MainProgram
